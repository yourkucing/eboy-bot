		description: 'Narcissus (Narcissi) (often called a daffodil) is the botanic name for a genus of mainly hardy, mostly spring-flowering, bulbs in the Amaryllidaceae family. They are native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia. It has pale yellow perianths with a darker central trumpet (paracorolla or "corona"). The long, narrow leaves are slightly greyish in colour and rise from the base of the stem. During the winter, the flowering part of narcissi dies away, and the plant lives on underground in a bulb. A bulb is an onionlike structure, filled with food. The plant lives off this food during the winter, protected from the cold by the soil above.'
