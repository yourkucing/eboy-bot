        \nHappy birthday, Liam! Even though we're not super close to you, we've always had fun talking to you as well as looking at your amazing drawings. You have a real amazing talent there, you know? Remind me to someday commission you to draw our DnD characters :wink: Anyway, we really do hope that you have an amazing birthday. I know this isn't much but just have fun today, okay? You deserve it.
        \nAnd one final thing: Thank you for always posting in the positivity channel in EC. I think you helped a number of people, and I (Maryam) am actually one of those. I never really got to thank you cos I'm a terrified midget but thank you. You're one of the coolest beans I've ever met.
        \nAnd now, your true birthday present from us. Are you ready? Since you love DnD and roleplaying a whole lot, we have decided to put YOU in a series of... adventures, let's say. Along the way, you'll stumble upon different choices, different notes. But would you survive at the end? Who knows?
        \n**DISCLAIMER: IT'S REALLY SHORT OKAY, my brain isn't made for long campaigns but we hope you love it!**
        \nIf you're ready for Liam the character to be whoopeâ€” I mean, to have so much fun, type \`uwu adventure\``)
